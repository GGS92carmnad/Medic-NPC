To use this addon, go to lua/medic_npc/sh_config.lua to configure it to your liking, including any changes to language if you require.

To save the NPC, simply spawn it in from Q under Carm's Entities in Entities, place it where you want, then use the chat command !savemedicnpc

To update its position, just move it and save it again using !savemedicnpc

To remove an NPC, simply look at it and use the chat command !removemedicnpc

In case an NPC is accidentally moved, admins can run the chat command !reloadmedicnpc to move it back to its original position.
(This also updates its playermodel without need for restart if MedicNPC.Config.Model is changed).
